/*
1. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets us vary their interaction independently.
2. Mediator helps to facilitate the interaction between objects in a manner in that objects are not aware of the existence of other objects. 
3. Objects depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of other objects.
4. Used in multicasting/broadcasting.

e.g:
A great real world example of mediator pattern is traffic control room at airports. 
If all flights will have to interact with each other for finding which flight is going to land next, it will create a big mess.
Rather flights only send their status to the tower. These towers in turn send the signals to conform which airplane can take-off or land. 
We must note that these towers do not control the whole flight. They only enforce constraints in the terminal areas.

Another good example of mediator pattern is a chat application. In a chat application we can have several participants. 
Itâ€™s not a good idea to connect each participant to all the others because the number of connections would be really high. 
The best solution is to have a hub where all participants will connect; this hub is just the mediator class.
