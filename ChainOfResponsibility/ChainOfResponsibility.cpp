/*
1. The Chain of Responsibility is known as a behavioral pattern. 
2. The main objective of this pattern is that it avoids coupling the sender of the request to the receiver, giving more than one object the opportunity to handle the request.
3. This pattern is recommended when multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesnâ€™t have to be a specific object. Also, handler is determined at runtime.

e.g:
ATM machine can dispense notes of Rs 100, 200, 500 and 2000. If a request comes to dispense 4800, it should get dispensed as 
2 * 2000, 1 * 500, 1 * 200 and 1 * 100.
